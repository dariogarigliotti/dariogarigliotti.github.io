    <p>Web search has become a key technology on which people rely on a daily basis.  
The evolution of the search experience has also shaped the expectations of people about it.    
Many users seem to expect today’s search engines to behave like a kind of “wise interpreter,” capable of understanding the meaning behind a search query, realizing its current context, and responding to it directly and appropriately.  
Semantic search encompasses a large portion of information retrieval (IR) research devoted to study more meaningful representations of the user information need.  
Entity cards, direct displays, and verticals are examples of how major commercial search engines have indeed capitalized on query understanding.  
Search is usually performed with a specific goal underlying the query.  
In many cases, this goal consists of a nontrivial task to be completed.  
Current search engines support a small set of basic tasks, and most of the knowledge-intensive workload for supporting more complex tasks is left to the user.  
Task-based search can be viewed as an information access paradigm that aims to enhance search engines with functionalities for recognizing the underlying tasks in searches and providing support for task completion.  
The research presented in this thesis focuses on utilizing and extending methods and techniques from semantic search in the next stage of the evolution: to support users in achieving their tasks.  
Our work can be grouped in three grand themes:
(1) <i>Entity type information for entity retrieval:</i> we conduct a systematic evaluation and analysis of methods for type-aware entity retrieval, in terms of three main dimensions.  
We revisit the problem of hierarchical target type identification, present a state-of-the-art supervised learning method, and analyze the usage of automatically identified target entity types for type-aware entity retrieval;  
(2) <i>Entity-oriented search intents:</i> we propose a categorization scheme for entity-oriented search intents, and study the distributions of entity intent categories per entity type.  
We develop a method for constructing a knowledge base of entity-oriented search intents;
and (3) <i>Task-based search:</i> we design a probabilistic generative framework for task-based query suggestion, and principledly estimate each of its components.  
We introduce the problems of query-based task recommendation and mission-based task recommendation, and establish respective suitable baselines.

    <p>In traditional machine teaching, a teacher wants to teach a concept to a learner, by means of a finite set of examples, the witness set. But concepts can have many equivalent representations. This redundancy strongly affects the search space, to the extent that teacher and learner may not be able to easily determine the equivalence class of each representation. In this common situation, instead of teaching concepts, we explore the idea of teaching representations. We work with several teaching schemas that exploit representation and witness size (Eager, Greedy and Optimal) and analyze the gains in teaching effectiveness for some representational languages (DNF expressions and Turing-complete P3 programs). Our theoretical and experimental results indicate that there are various types of redundancy, handled better by the Greedy schema introduced here than by the Eager schema, although both can be arbitrarily far away from the Optimal. For P3 programs we found that witness sets are usually smaller than the programs they identify, which is an illuminating justification of why machine teaching from examples makes sense at all.</p>

    <p>Large language models have become multimodal, and many of them are said to integrate their modalities using common representations. If this were true, a drawing of a car as an image, for instance, should map to a similar area in the latent space as a textual description of the strokes that form the drawing. To explore this in a black-box access regime to these models, we propose the use of machine teaching, a theory that studies the minimal set of examples a teacher needs to choose so that the learner captures the concept. In this paper, we evaluate the complexity of teaching vision-language models a subset of objects in the Quick, Draw! dataset using two presentations: raw images as bitmaps and trace coordinates in TikZ format. The results indicate that image-based representations generally require fewer segments and achieve higher accuracy than coordinate-based representations. But, surprisingly, the teaching size usually ranks concepts similarly across both modalities, even when controlling for (a human proxy of) concept priors, suggesting that the simplicity of concepts may be an inherent property that transcends modality representations.</p>

    <p>With the consolidation of Large Language Models (LLM) as a dominant component in approaches for multiple linguistic tasks, the interest in these technologies has greatly increased within a variety of areas and domains. A particular scenario of information needs where to exploit these approaches is climate-aware NLP. Paradigmatically, the vast manual labour of inspecting long, heterogeneous documents to find environment-relevant expressions and claims suits well within a recently established Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) framework. In this paper, we tackle two dual problems within environment analysis dealing with the common goal of detecting a Sustainable Developmental Goal (SDG) target being addressed in a textual passage of an environmental assessment report.We develop relevant test collections, and propose and evaluate a series of methods within the general RAG pipeline, in order to assess the current capabilities of LLMs for the tasks of SDG target evidence identification and SDG target detection.</p>

    <p>The paradigm shift unleashed by Entity-Oriented Search still characterizes a vast space of the dynamics with which users engage in digital information access, from Web search to e-commerce and social networks. The progress in research around Entity Retrieval tasks has in particular shown the convenience of incorporating type-based information for entities in their methods to provide relevant answers to queries. As types are typically accessible in an ontology of reference within the knowledge base where their assigned entities live, automatically identifying query target types is a relevant problem to tackle. In this work, we propose to address the task of Query Target Type Identification by assessing the capabilities of Large Language Models that have recently shown widespread success. Our experimentation with methods based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation over a purposely built test collection from the literature challenges a well-established closed LLM by presenting it with entity type information from a resource within the core in hubbing Linked Open Data.</p>

    <p>As administrative language tends to be formal and exempt from double meanings or figurative expressions, it is a particular domain in which to explore the performance of Language Models. This paper presents a study on the feasibility of creating administrative texts-based RAG systems to serve as chatbots, analyzing the performance for this task of several Small and Large Language Models and defining ways of evaluating whether they hallucinate or not and whether they provide the user useful information or not. Conventional metrics depending on ground truth labels, such as cosine similarity or those from the ROUGE family, are explored, as well as new approaches to using other metrics not so popular in text evaluation, such as Euclidean and Manhattan distances. Moreover, all those objective metrics are compared with a subjective Likert scale to assess their performance at solving real users’ problems and to find relations between subjective perceptions and ob- jectively measured metrics for each of the RAG systems proposed. The results show that SLM models (such as NeuralChat) can perform as well as an LLM if RAG programming provides them with an appropriate context.</p>

    <p>When answering a user query with relevant entities from a knowledge base (KB), utilizing their semantic class or type information typically structured in the KB is known to improve the retrieval per- formance for these entities. Accordingly, it is important to identify the target types of entities expected by a query. This work addresses the task of Target Type Identification (TTI) by replacing the established supervisedly learnt ranking approach with a generative approach pow- ered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Beyond assessing the ability of LLMs at predicting query target types, we study aspects of the strategy to elicit generation, in particular, the role of example relevant entities in supporting the explanation of mechanisms behind the LLM predictions.</p>

    <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the state- of-the-art technology in a variety of language understanding tasks. Accordingly, many commercial organizations have been increasingly trying to integrate LLMs in multiple areas of their production and analytics. A typical scenario is the need for answering questions over a domain-specific, private collection of documents, such that the answer is supported by evidence clearly referenced from those documents. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework has been recently used by many applications for this kind of scenarios, as it intuitively bridges dedicated data collections and state-of-the-art generative models. Yet, LLMs are known to present data con- tamination, a phenomenon in which their performance on evaluation data relevant to a task is influenced by said data being already incor- porated to the LLM during training phase. In this paper, we assess the performance of LLMs within the domain of Equinor, the largest energy company in Norway. Specifically, we address question answering with a RAG-based approach over a novel data collection not available for well-established LLMs during training, in order to study the effect of data contamination for this task. Beyond shedding light on LLM performance for a highly-demanded, realistic indus- trial scenario, we also analyze its potential impact for an ensemble of personas in Equinor with particular information needs and contexts.</p>

    <p>With the establishment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework, practitioners in environmental impact assessment have an increasing requirement to detect relevant information centered on this frame of reference. The task of automatically identifying evidence that supports the project actually addressing a particular SDG target becomes crucial for enabling assessment digitalization across long, heterogeneous documents. In this work, we tackle SDG evidence identification via the well-suited Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) approach pow- ered by Large Language Models (LLM). The identified evidence may also support further related tasks in conceptual modeling where reports or parts of their content are to be assigned to entries in a structured resource such as a domain-specific ontology. Beyond the measurement of performance of a series of method configurations on this task, we also assess RAG abilities for making this kind of decisions when the LLM is requested to explain its own mechanisms alongside the answer it gener- ates. Our evaluation resources are made publicly available.</p>

    <p>Data contamination occurs when test instances have been compromised during a training stage of building a machine learning model. The consequences of this phenomenon over the quality of learning data are crucial when evaluating a learned predictor, since it could dis- tort the assessment of the actual capabilities of the system. Its study has recently gained more traction in the research on Large Language Mod- els, where it is common to chase performances in order to support claims about model abilities.

    <p>Test contamination is a serious problem for the evaluation of large language models (LLMs) because it leads to the overestimation of their performance and a quick saturation of benchmarks, even before the actual capability is achieved. One strategy to address this issue is the (adversarial) generation of variations, by including different exemplars and different rephrasings of the questions. However, these two interventions can lead to instances that can be more difficult (accumulating on the expected loss of performance by partly removing the contamination) but also to instances that can be less difficult (cancelling the expected loss of performance), which would make contamination undetectable. Understanding these two phenomena in terms of instance difficulty is critical to determine and measure contamination. In this paper we conduct a comprehensive analysis of these two interventions on an addition task with fine-tuned LLAMA-2 models.</p>

    <p>In the context of multiple spaces of research and application in text and information processing dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) provides a general framework with which to integrate external, explicit knowledge into the vast parametric knowledge of LLMs. In this paper, we present a crosspoint of tasks of diverse nature, maturity and level of cognitive challenge for an intelligent system, that nevertheless share in their analogies the suitability for being addressed by a similar RAG approach. Based on observations from several of our recent works, we reflect on the RAG framework, in particular about methods where the LLM is prompted with strategies to explain its generation output, across these tasks with components ranging from unstructured to structured data.</p>

    <p>An environmental assessment (EA) report describes and assesses the environmental impact of a series of activities involved in the development of a project. As such, EA is a key tool for sustainability. Improving information access to EA reporting is a billion-euro untapped business opportunity to build an engaging, efficient digital experience for EA. We aim to become a landmark initiative in making this experience come true, by transforming the traditional manual assessment of numerous heterogeneous reports by experts into a computer-assisted approach. Specifically, a knowledge graph that represents and stores facts about EA practice allows for what it is so far only accessible manually to become machine-readable, and by this, to enable downstream information access services. This paper describes the ongoing process of building DreamsKG, a knowledge graph that stores relevant data- and expert-driven EA reporting and practicing in Denmark. Representation of cause-effect relations in EA and integration of Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs) are among its prominent features.</p>

    <p>Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a required process for projects in many countries, which results in the preparation and publication of a detailed report. Such EIA reports describe impacts on, e.g., humans and the environment. In this paper, we describe our efforts in modeling the metadata of EIA reports and their description of environmental impacts and mitigations with Wikidata and Wikibase. We show that it is possible to record the bibliographic metadata of Danish EIA reports and in doing so link it to the rest of the Wikidata knowledge graph, allowing multilingual search. With our dedicated instance of a Wikibase, we show how EIA reports and their associated projects along with activities, impacts, recipients, and mitigations can be represented and how we can show aggregated views of the data based on SPARQL templates so that users can explore the data and make efficient use of it.</p>

    <p>Web search is an experience that naturally lends itself to recommendations, including query suggestions and related entities. In this article, we propose to recommend specific tasks to users, based on their search queries, such as planning a holiday trip or organizing a party. Specifically, we introduce the problem of query-based task recommendation and develop methods that combine well-established term-based ranking techniques with continuous semantic representations, including sentence representations from several transformer-based models. Using a purpose-built test collection, we find that our method is able to significantly outperform a strong text-based baseline. Further, we extend our approach to using a set of queries that all share the same underlying task, referred to as search mission, as input. The study is rounded off with a detailed feature and query analysis.</p>

    <p>Web search has become a key technology on which people rely daily for getting information about almost everything. The evolution of the search experience has also shaped the expectations of people about it. Many users seem to expect today’s web search engines to behave like a kind of "wise interpreter," capable of understanding the meaning behind a search query, realizing its current context, and responding to it directly and appropriately. Search by meaning, or semantic search, encompasses a large portion of information retrieval (IR) research devoted to study more meaningful representations of the information need expressed by the user query. Entity cards, direct displays, and verticals are examples of how major commercial search engines have indeed responded to user expectations, capitalizing on query understanding. Search is usually performed with a specific goal underlying the query. In many cases, this goal consists of a nontrivial task to be completed. Current search engines support a small set of basic tasks, and most of the knowledge-intensive workload for supporting more complex tasks is left to the user.Task-based search can be viewed as an information access paradigm that aims to enhance search engines with functionalities for recognizing the underlying tasks in searches and providing support for task completion. The research presented in this thesis focuses on utilizing and extending methods and techniques from semantic search in the next stage of the evolution of search engines, namely, to support users in achieving their tasks. Our work can be grouped in three grand themes: (1) Entity type information for entity retrieval: we conduct a systematic evaluation and analysis of methods for type-aware entity retrieval, in terms of three main dimensions. Also, we revisit the problem of hierarchical target type identification, present a state-of-the-art supervised learning method, and analyze the usage of automatically identified target entity types for type-aware entity retrieval; (2) Entity-oriented search intents: we propose a categorization scheme for entity-oriented search intents, and study the distributions of entity intent categories per entity type. We further develop a method for constructing a knowledge base of entity-oriented search intents; and (3) Task-based search: we design a probabilistic generative framework for task-based query suggestion, and principledly estimate each of its components. Furthermore, we introduce the problems of query-based task recommendation and mission-based task recommendation, and establish respective methods as suitable baselines.</p>

    <p>This work is a study of the impact of multiple aspects in a classic unsupervised word sense disambiguation algorithm.  We identify relevant factors in a decision rule algorithm, including the initial labeling of examples, the formalization of the rule confidence, and the criteria for accepting a decision rule.  Some of these factors are only implicitly considered in the original literature.  We then propose a lightly supervised version of the algorithm, and employ a pseudo-word-based strategy to evaluate the impact of these factors.  The obtained performances are comparable with those of highly optimized formulations of the word sense disambiguation method.</p>

    <p>Knowledge bases store information about the semantic types of entities, which can be utilized in a range of information access tasks.  This information, however, is often incomplete, due to new entities emerging on a daily basis.  We address the task of automatically assigning types to entities in a knowledge base from a type taxonomy.  Specifically, we present two neural network architectures, which take short entity descriptions and, optionally, information about related entities as input.  Using the DBpedia knowledge base for experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that these simple architectures yield significant improvements over the current state of the art.</p>

    <p>Monitoring entities in media streams often relies on rich entity representations, like structured information available in a knowledge base (KB).  For long-tail entities, such monitoring is highly challenging, due to their limited, if not entirely missing, representation in the reference KB.  In this paper, we address the problem of retrieving textual contexts for monitoring long-tail entities.  We propose an unsupervised method to overcome the limited representation of long-tail entities by leveraging established entities and their contexts as support information.  Evaluation on a purpose-built test collection shows the suitability of our approach and its robustness for out-of-KB entities.</p>

    <p>Today, the practice of returning entities from a knowledge base in response to search queries has become widespread. One of the distinctive characteristics of entities is that they are typed, i.e., assigned to some hierarchically organized type system (type taxonomy). The primary objective of this paper is to gain a better understanding of how entity type information can be utilized in entity retrieval. We perform this investigation in two settings: firstly, in an idealized “oracle” setting, assuming that we know the distribution of target types of the relevant entities for a given query; and secondly, in a realistic scenario, where target entity types are identified automatically based on the keyword query. We perform a thorough analysis of three main aspects: (i) the choice of type taxonomy, (ii) the representation of hierarchical type information, and (iii) the combination of type-based and term-based similarity in the retrieval model. Using a standard entity search test collection based on DBpedia, we show that type information can significantly and substantially improve retrieval performance, yielding up to 67% relative improvement in terms of NDCG@10 over a strong text-only baseline in an oracle setting. We further show that using automatic target type detection, we can outperform the text-only baseline by 44% in terms of NDCG@10. This is as good as, and sometimes even better than, what is attainable by using explicit target type information provided by humans. These results indicate that identifying target entity types of queries is challenging even for humans and attests to the effectiveness of our proposed automatic approach.</p>

    <p>We address the problem of constructing a knowledge base of entity-oriented search intents.  Search intents are defined on the level of entity types, each comprising of a high-level intent category (property, website, service, or other), along with a cluster of query terms used to express that intent.  These machine-readable statements can be leveraged in various applications, e.g., for generating entity cards or query recommendations.  By structuring service-oriented search intents, we take one step towards making entities actionable.  The main contribution of this paper is a pipeline of components we develop to construct a knowledge base of entity intents.  We evaluate performance both component-wise and end-to-end, and demonstrate that our approach is able to generate high-quality data.</p>

    <p>Web search has become a key technology in society.  The increased engagement of users has enhanced their expectations, leading to an evolution of search engines towards attempting an understanding, or <i>semantics</i>, of information needs.  The next paradigm shift is to support <i>task completion</i>, this is, to help the user complete her underlying goal when issuing a search query.  In this research, I propose to study semantic search components suitable for task-based search.  Our contributions address three main challenges, which are as follows.  We conduct a systematic formalization and evaluation of aspects in utilizing entity type information for entity retrieval.  We also approach to understanding entity-oriented queries by categorization of search intents.  Last, we develop methods for generating high-quality task-based query suggestions.  We envisage the capability of the three identified components to complement each other for supporting task completion.</p>

    <p>Entity-oriented search deals with a wide variety of information needs, from displaying direct answers to interacting with services. In this work, we aim to understand what are prominent entity-oriented search intents and how they can be fulfilled. We develop a scheme of entity intent categories, and use them to annotate a sample of queries. Specifically, we annotate unique query refiners on the level of entity types. We observe that, on average, over half of those refiners seek to interact with a service, while over a quarter of the refiners search for information that may be looked up in a knowledge base.</p>

In this paper, we solve the task without reliance on search engines. Specifically, we focus on the first step of a two-stage pipeline approach, which is dedicated to the generation of query suggestion candidates. We present three methods for generating candidate suggestions and apply them on multiple information sources. Using a purpose-built test collection, we find that these methods are able to generate high-quality suggestion candidates.</p>

    <p>Identifying the target types of entity-bearing queries can help improve retrieval performance as well as the overall search experience. In this work, we address the problem of automatically detecting the target types of a query with respect to a type taxonomy. We propose a supervised learning approach with a rich variety of features. Using a purpose-built test collection, we show that our approach outperforms existing methods by a remarkable margin.</p>

    <p>We address the problem of generating query suggestions to support users in completing their underlying tasks (which motivated them to search in the first place). Given an initial query, these query suggestions should provide a coverage of possible subtasks the user might be looking for. We propose a probabilistic modeling framework that obtains keyphrases from multiple sources and generates query suggestions from these keyphrases. Using the test suites of the TREC Tasks track, we evaluate and analyze each component of our model.</p>

We designed two extraction tasks: (1) Entity Recognition, Linking and Typing and (2) Class Induction and entity typing. The challenge saw the participations of four systems: CETUS-FOX and FRED participating to both tasks, Adel participating to Task 1 and OAK@Sheffield participat- ing to Task 2. In this paper we describe the OKE challenge, the tasks, the datasets used for training and evaluating the systems, the evaluation method, and obtained results.</p>

Observamos y clasificamos fenómenos lingüísticos sobre un cuerpo de ejemplos de especificaciones.  
A su vez, exploramos algunos sistemas presentados en la literatura relacionada,
identificando sus mejores características.  
A partir de las mismas, diseñamos e implementamos un sistema que
interprete una especificación, expresada en un formato muy simple e informativo,
y obtenga un sistema de transiciones etiquetadas.  
La estrategia de resolución combina
un enfoque interactivo con heurísticas ad-hoc de decisión.  
Se enriquece la
representación con el tratamiento de fenómenos semánticos.

    <p>Este trabajo es una exploración sistemática del impacto de diferentes aspectos de los algoritmos clásicos de desambiguación -no supervisada- de sentidos.  
  Tras identificar los factores relevantes para su funcionamiento, muchos de los cuales estaban solamente implícitos en la descripción de estos algoritmos, implementamos una versión simplificada y levemente supervisada de un algoritmo clásico de reglas de decisión para desambiguación no supervisada.  
  Evaluamos el impacto de cada uno de estos factores en el desempeño del mismo, entre ellos: el leve etiquetado inicial de ejemplos, la ecuación de confiabilidad de una regla y los criterios de aceptación de tales reglas de decisión.  
  Los resultados obtenidos mediante una económica y poderosa evaluación con pseudo-palabras exhiben una performance aceptable en comparación con versiones muy optimizadas, y nos llevan a proponer prometedoras mejoras a futuro.</p>
